We analyzed the open restaurant application data for Brooklyn in five different neighborhoods: Dumbo, Bay Ridge, Bushwick, Greenpoint, and Sheepshead Bay. We observed the similaraties between each neighborhood and how they ranked against one another in the three qualities—transit access, greenery/shade, safety—we deemed most desirable for outdoor dining. Our data analysis involved observations about how the Brooklyn data compared to the other boroughs along with how the specific neighborhoods were reflected. This analysis focused on aspects of the applications that related to these qualities, such as how the amount of alcohol-serving restaurants relates to the safety of the area.
