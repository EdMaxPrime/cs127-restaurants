<h2>Demographics and Overview</h2>
<p>Sheepshead Bay is the most mixed-use neighborhood. Manhattan Beach and Gerritsen Beach are low-density residential neighborhoods full of single-family homes and duplexes.
There are 4 commercial thoroughfares. Avenue U is home to Asian-owned businesses. Sheepshead Bay Road and Emmons Avenue host waterside restaurants and bars. Coney Island Avenue is lined with strip malls which host ethnic cuisine.
Almost half the residents are foreign born, and 63% speak a language other than English. Most people work outside the neighborhood since the average commute is 48 minutes.

<h2>Neighborhood Rankings</h2>
<ul>
	<li><em>Public Transit:</em> The B and Q trains only reach a small part of the area. Buses travel along big commercial thoroughfares to weave surrounding southern Brooklyn neighborhoods together. There are bike lanes and the neighborhood is walkable.</li>
	<li><em>Greenery and Shade:</em> The proximity to the water and many parks creates moderate average temperatures year-round. Most buildings are below 3 stories, though.</li>
	<li><em>Safety:</em> The biggest danger in the area are drunk and aggressive drivers.</li>
</ul>
