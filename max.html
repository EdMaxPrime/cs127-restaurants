<h1>Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan Beach and Gerritsen Beach</h1>

<img src="bay-highlighted.png" />

<p>Sheepshead Bay is the most mixed-use neighborhood. Manhattan Beach and Gerritsen Beach are low-density residential neighborhoods full of single-family homes and duplexes.
There are 4 commercial thoroughfares. Avenue U is home to Asian-owned businesses. Sheepshead Bay Road and Emmons Avenue host waterside restaurants and bars. Coney Island Avenue is lined with strip malls which host ethnic cuisine.
Almost half the residents are foreign born, and 63% speak a language other than English. Most people work outside the neighborhood since the average commute is 48 minutes.
